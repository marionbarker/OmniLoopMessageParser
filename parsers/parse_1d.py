    # extract information from the 1d response and return as a dictionary
    """
    The $1D status response is sent from the Pod to provide information on its
    internal state, including insulin delivery, unacknowledged alerts,
    Pod active time, reservoir level, etc. as the normal response to
    non-specialized commands. This page explains how the different values are
    packed into the $1D status response.

    It is the only command without an mlen value
     - always fixed length of 12 bytes

    The $1D status response has the following form:
        00 01 02030405 06070809
        1d SS 0PPPSNNN AATTTTRR
